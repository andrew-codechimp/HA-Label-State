Label State Helpers for Home Assistant

You can create both state and numeric state helpers which provide a binary sensor that turns on if any entity with an assigned label matches the criteria you specify.

An `entities` attribute is available which lists all entities that match the criteria.

## Example use cases

- Create a critical sensors label and create a Label State helper which turns on when any of those entities goes unavailable so you can get a notification.
- If you have appliances which should always draw a certain wattage create a numeric Label State helper to turn on when any of those devices starts drawing 0 watts, triggering a notification.

## Installation

### HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=andrew-codechimp&repository=HA-Label-State&category=Integration)

Restart Home Assistant

In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Devices & services" -> "Helpers" click "+" and select "Label State"

### Manual Installation

## Tips
To create a notification message listing the entities use the state_attr, replacing the binary sensor with your own.

```
action: persistent_notification.create
metadata: {}
data:
  message: >-
    Critical sensors are unavailable {{
    state_attr('binary_sensor.critical_sensors_unavailable', 'entities') |
    join(', ') }}
```

### Translations

You can help by adding missing translations when you are a native speaker. Or add a complete new language when there is no language file available.

Label State uses Crowdin to make contributing easy.

**Adding a new language**

Create an [Issue](https://github.com/andrew-codechimp/HA-Label-State/issues/) requesting a new language. We will do the necessary work to add the new translation to the integration and Crowdin site, when it's ready for you to contribute we'll comment on the issue you raised.
